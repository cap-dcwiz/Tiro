# Asset Library

We have created a library of assets common used in data centers. One can directly use the assets in scenario definitions. The library is available in the [Tiro asset library](https://github.com/cap-dcwiz/Tiro-asset-library) repository.

The library is currently in a private repository. To access the library, please contact us.
